    "Scaling is important because variance in a feature measured in a relatively small unit can be just as or more important than a feature measured in a large unit. In other words, the dependent variable may depend more on the feature with the smaller unit than the large. When transforming a dataset with PCA, the PCA object finds the direction that explains the most total variance in the feature set. It will then tend to identify features with larger units as the most important. By scaling, the unit is taken out of the picture. PCA will be able to identify features whose original scale is smaller, but whose variation correlates more closely with the dependent feature.\n",
    "Take for example a model that attempts to predict weight of a new born with age of the mother in years and height of the mother in meters. Without scaling, the total variance of age across all subjects will be much greater than the total variance of height, simply because of the unit. If one fits a PCA object to height and age, the first principal component will be more heavily influenced by age. However, the height of the mother likely is a better predictor than age, but because of its relatively small variance in the original unit (meters), its influence is obscured. By scaling, PCA will consider the relative variance of height and age without regard for the unit."

    "Each successive principal component explains a different aspect of the variance of the feature set. After the PCA object has been fit, it has an attribute named explained_variance_ratio, which describes what percentage of the variance is explained by each component. The first component will have the largest value for explained variance ratio. And the variance explained will decrease with each successive component. At some point, adding another principal component will result in only a small additional percent of variance explained. Looking at a graph of the number of components vs. cumulative explained variance ratio, the curve will stop increasing significantly and start to level off. A good choice for the number of principal components would be the component after which a significant increase of explained variance stops.\n",
    "The PCA object can also be given a proportion as the argument p_components. PCA will stop after that decimal. If .8 is given, PCA will stop adding components after the previous components have explained 80% of the variance.\n",
